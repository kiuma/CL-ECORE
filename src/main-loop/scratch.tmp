  "Pollers are, in essence, callbacks that share a single timer per type. Because not all pollers need to be called at the same frequency the user may specify the frequency in ticks(each expiration of the shared timer is called a tick, in ecore poller parlance) for each added poller. Ecore pollers should only be used when the poller doesn't have specific requirements on the exact times to poll.

This architecture means that the main loop is only woken up once to handle all pollers of that type, this will save power as the CPU has more of a chance to go into a low power state the longer it is asleep for, so this should be used in situations where power usage is a concern.

This macro creates a poller to call the given function \(job\) at a particular tick interval. 

Returns an EPOLLER instance"
